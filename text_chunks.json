Prepare each recipe separately and then combine each component into a plastic or glass container that you can take with you on the go.\n\nFor the Chicken: 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup lemon juice 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 Tbsp. dried oregano 1/2 tsp salt Freshly cracked pepper 1.5 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 2) or 4-6 chicken thighs", "1. Add olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper to a large zip top bag, or a large shallow dish. Close the bag and massage to mix the ingredients, or stir the ingredients in the dish until combined. 2. Filet each chicken breast into two thinner pieces. You should now have 4 pieces of chicken. Place the pieces in the bag or dish, making sure the chicken pieces are completely covered in marinade. Marinate the chicken for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours, turning occasionally to maximize the chicken's contact with the marinade. The longer you marinate the chicken, the more flavorful it will be. 3. When ready to cook, heat a large skillet over medium flame or on medium heat. Transfer the chicken from the marinade to the hot skillet and cook on each side until well browned and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes each side, depending on the size of the pieces). I cooked two pieces at a time to avoid over-crowding the skillet, which can cause juices to pool and prevents browning. Discard any excess marinade. 4.

Add the kale and continue to saut\u00e9 until the kale has wilted and has turned a deep green color (about 5-7 minutes). Turn the heat off. 4. Add the drained pasta to the pot with the saut\u00e9ed kale. Toss the pasta and kale together. Allow them to cool to the point that steam is no longer rising from the pot.
